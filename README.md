# GS on Highly Polyploid species

Supplementary data and code for paper entitled "Genomic prediction with allele dosage information in highly polyploid species"

File names and descriptions are very self exlanatory but here are the contents of this repo:

## Sugarcane folder

Phenotypic and SNP data can be found in the "Sugarcane_data.RData" file.
The code to get the GRMs when you have mixed Ploidy levels can be found in the "GRMs_sugarcane.R" file

## SweetPotato folder

Phenotypic and SNP data can be found in the "SweetPotato_data.RData" file.
The code to get the GRMs when you have an hexaploid species can be found in the "GRMs_sweetpotato.R" file

## Simulation folder

AlphaSimR code to generate the same simulated datasets I used in the paper
"/SweetPotato/GRMs_sweetpotato.R" can be used to get the GRMs here (I simulated an hexaploid)
